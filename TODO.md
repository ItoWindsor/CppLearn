# TODO 

## Implementation of Machine Learning models 

### Linear Regression 
- Implementation of ridge & lasso linear regression 
    - Check what would be the best approach -> new classes OR the regularization is a part of LinearRegresion ? 

### Logistic Regression
- Implementation of logistic regression 

### Decision Tree
- Implementation of a base decison tree

## Implementation of optimizer 

### Gradient Descent 
- Implementation of the naive gradient descent (alpha / learning rate fixed by the user)

## DevOps 

### tests 
- Add some tests for the linear regression 
    - Check the coefficients obtained by OLS 
    - Check the difference between OLS coefficients and iterative methods (newton-raphson and gradient descent)
